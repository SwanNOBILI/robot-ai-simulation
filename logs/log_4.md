## **In this session, I worked during 3 hours**
<br> <br>

## I added a goal position that the Robot needs to reach. The Start position of the Robot is represented by a blue square, and the Goal position is representend by a red square.
<br><br>

## I added the fact that the Arena is now defined as a node, so that I can directly import/modify it within the supervisor.
<br><br>

## I modified the boxes spawn. Now they will more likely spawn on the perpendicular directions of the path between the Robot start & goal positions (so that we always have an obstacle on our path).
